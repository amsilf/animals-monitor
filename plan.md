I'll help you break down this project into manageable steps for a junior developer. Here's a development plan:
1. Project Setup and Environment Preparation
Install required libraries and dependencies
OpenCV for video capture and image processing
AWS SDK (boto3) for S3 interaction
Basic file handling libraries
Set up project structure
Create separate modules for different functionalities
Set up configuration files for camera and AWS settings
2. Camera Stream Implementation (Phase 1)
Create a basic camera handler class
Initialize camera connection
Implement frame capture
Add error handling for camera issues
Test camera stream
Verify frame capture
Check frame quality and resolution
Implement basic frame display for debugging
3. Object Detection Setup (Phase 2)
Choose and implement object detection method
Options:
1. Basic motion detection (easier to start with)
Pre-trained model (YOLOv5 or SSD)
Create object detection class
Frame preprocessing
Object detection logic
Result parsing
4. New Object Entry Detection (Phase 3)
Implement object tracking logic
Track object positions between frames
Define entry/exit zones in frame
Create logic to identify new objects
Add filtering mechanism
Minimum object size
Confidence threshold
Duplicate detection prevention
5. Local Storage Implementation (Phase 4)
Create image saving module
Generate unique filenames (timestamp + identifier)
Implement efficient save mechanism
Add metadata (time, detection info)
Implement storage management
Directory structure
Cleanup old files
Storage space monitoring
6. S3 Upload Implementation (Phase 5)
Create S3 upload module
AWS authentication
Upload queue management
Error handling and retries
Implement background upload
Queue system for pending uploads
Upload status tracking
Network connection handling
7. System Integration (Phase 6)
Connect all components
Implement main program loop
8. Testing and Optimization
Performance testing
Frame processing speed
Memory usage
Storage efficiency
Error handling
Camera disconnection
Network issues
Storage full scenarios
System stability
Long-running tests
Resource monitoring
9. Documentation and Deployment
Code documentation
Function descriptions
Configuration guide
Usage examples
System requirements
Installation guide
Troubleshooting guide
Additional Considerations
Memory Management
Buffer sizes for video stream
Image storage limitations

Resolution optimization
Background task management
Configuration Options
Camera parameters
Detection sensitivity
Storage paths
AWS credentials
This plan provides a structured approach to building the system incrementally. Each phase builds upon the previous one, making it easier to test and debug. Start with basic functionality and gradually add more complex features.
